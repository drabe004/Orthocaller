# üß¨ Orthocaller v3

**Orthocaller v3** is a gene tree-based orthogroup classification tool for comparative genomics. It uses reconciled gene trees (e.g., from **GeneRax**) and a rooted species tree to identify conserved, duplicated, and lost orthologs across species.

---

## üö® What's New in v3?

This version introduces **flexible in-paralog resolution**, with three user-selectable strategies for deciding which in-paralog copy to retain:

| Strategy            | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `farthest` (default) | Retains the most diverged in-paralog (longest branch from duplication node). |
| `shortest`          | Retains the least diverged in-paralog (shortest branch).                     |
| `average_divergence`| Retains the copy whose branch length ratio is closest to the duplication node ‚Äî a proxy for balanced divergence. |

## üìñ Overview
**Orthocaller v2.0** classifies orthogroups using reconciled gene trees (e.g., from **GeneRax**), a rooted species tree, and a gene-to-species map.  
It identifies evolutionary events like:
- ‚úÖ Conserved orthologs  
- üîÅ Species-specific duplications  
- ‚ùå Gene losses  
- üß© Paralogy  

It outputs ortholog group tables, annotated trees, and classification summaries‚Äîideal for comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses.

## Description
This script classifies orthogroups using reconciled gene trees (e.g., from GeneRax), a rooted species tree, and a gene-to-species map. It identifies evolutionary events such as conserved orthologs, species-specific duplications, gene losses, and paralogy, and outputs ortholog group tables, class summaries, and NHX/NWK tree files for downstream comparative genomic and functional analyses.Designed for evolutionary biologists, genome scientists, and comparative physiologists, this tool is optimized for large-scale, high-throughput orthogroup classification, particularly in cases where deep divergence, gene duplication, or gene loss might obscure one-to-one orthology relationships.Use case: This pipeline was developed to study convergent and lineage-specific patterns of gene evolution across cavefish species and background lineages‚Äîdistinguishing true orthologs from confounding paralogs or loss events using tree topology and evolutionary events inferred from reconciliation.

## Why Reconciliation?
Orthology inference based solely on clustering or sequence similarity (e.g., OrthoFinder or BLAST) often misses the mark in non-model or deeply diverged species. Reconciliation-based methods incorporate both gene trees and species trees, enabling better resolution of:
-In-paralogs (species-specific duplications)
-False orthology (where topology or branch lengths suggest a misclassification)
-Gene loss or gain events along specific branches
-This script wraps around reconciled trees from GeneRax and builds downstream annotations and ortholog tables.

## üì• Input Requirements

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-og` | Orthogroup name (e.g., `1_generax`) |
| `-st` | Rooted species tree in Newick format |
| `-rd` | Directory with GeneRax reconciled output |
| `-md` | Folder with gene-to-species `.map` files (e.g., Species:Seq1;Seq2).|
| `-od` | Output directory |
| `--cavefish_list` | Text file with cavefish species (1 per line) |
| `--background_list` | Text file with background species |


## üì§ Output Files per Orthogroup

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `*.nhx` | Annotated gene tree with species + evolutionary events |
| `*_decostar.nwk` | Pruned tree for DeCoSTAR input |
| `*_codeml.nwk` | Codeml-compatible tree |
| `*_expr.nhx` | Tree for expression overlay |
| `*_pruned_species.nwk` | Species tree with focal species only |
| `*_orthogroup.csv` | Table of orthologous genes |
| `*_genes.csv` | Gene-to-orthogroup key |
| `*_classes.csv` | Classifications per gene group |
| `summary.txt` | High-level stats & summary |

### Running the Script
You can run the script manually:
python ortho_caller_Version2_Official.py \
    -og 1_generax \
    -st SpeciesTree_rooted.tre \
    -rd GeneRax_Output_Dir \
    -md maps/ \
    -od 5.1_OG_classifications/ \
    --cavefish_list Cavefish_List.txt \
    --background_list BackgroundFish_List.txt

Or at scale using the included SLURM script (ortho_caller_Version2_Official.sh), which parallelizes across 3000 orthogroups using SLURM job arrays:
sbatch ortho_caller_Version2_Official.sh

This SLURM script:
Submits 3000 jobs (--array=1-3000)
Logs failed orthogroups for reruns
Scans logs to generate a list of failed jobs (failed_jobs_from_logs.txt)

This pipeline aims to improve orthogroup classification by integrating information from both gene and species trees in a biologically informed way. Gene trees alone can sometimes be misleading‚Äîtopological artifacts, missing data, or uneven evolutionary rates can obscure which genes are truly orthologous. By examining branch lengths and tree structure, we flag cases where one gene copy appears to evolve much faster than its sibling, which may indicate misassignment or unresolved duplication. We also recognize that not every inferred duplication event reflects true evolutionary history; some may be artifacts of limited phylogenetic resolution, so we apply conservative filters to reduce false positives. The fundamental assumption is that true orthologs will appear once per focal species. When this pattern is broken‚Äîdue to missing species or extra copies‚Äîit suggests gene loss or duplication, which we classify accordingly. In doing so, this pipeline provides a more nuanced and testable framework for understanding

Orthocaller v2 was developed by Andrew J. Mason (cit) and adapted by Danielle H Drabeck to address key challenges in distinguishing orthology, paralogy, and gene loss in large comparative datasets. The pipeline integrates reconciled gene trees, a reference species tree, and curated species mappings to classify orthogroups with sensitivity to topological uncertainty and branch length asymmetry.
